# Example Next.js Template for Cockpit Headless CMS

## About
I wrote this default template to ensure a quick and ease start for Cockpit Headless CMS. (https://getcockpit.com/)

It is based on Next.js, Typescript and Sass for styling.

Feel free to use it as your kickstart for an headless React/Next.js project.
I would appreciate every mention and comment.
